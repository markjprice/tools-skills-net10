**17. Hosting and Kestrel server**

"Can you explain what Kestrel is in the context of ASP.NET Core? How would you configure an ASP.NET Core application to use Kestrel and IIS together in a production environment, and why might this configuration be beneficial?"

# Good answer

"Kestrel is a cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core, built to run ASP.NET Core applications directly without relying on an external server. It's lightweight and capable of handling thousands of simultaneous connections, which makes it very suitable for microservices and applications that require high throughput and low latency.

In a production environment, it is common to pair Kestrel with a reverse proxy such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache. This setup leverages Kestrel's speed and efficiency while using the reverse proxy to manage more complex features like SSL termination, load balancing, and serving static files.

Kestrel can be configured directly in the Program.cs of your ASP.NET Core project, specifying various settings such as port and IP address, if needed. However, default settings are often sufficient for basic operations, as shown in the following code:
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Additional Kestrel configurations can be set here if needed.
builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(serverOptions =>
{
  // Configure limits, endpoints, and so on.
});

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World using Kestrel and IIS!");
app.Run();
```

Next, setup IIS as a reverse proxy. This requires configuring the IIS server and ensuring the ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle is installed on the server, which includes the .NET Runtime and IIS support.

Although ASP.NET Core projects do not rely on `web.config` files for most configurations, when hosted behind IIS, the `web.config` file is used to configure the ASP.NET Core Module, which manages the process startup and lifetime, as shown in the following markup:
```xml
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <handlers>
      <add name="aspNetCore" path="*" verb="*" 
        modules="AspNetCoreModuleV2" resourceType="Unspecified" />
    </handlers>
    <aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" arguments=".\YourApplication.dll" 
      forwardWindowsAuthToken="false" stdoutLogEnabled="true" 
      stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" />
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

The main benefits of using Kestrel with IIS include the following:
- Performance: Kestrel is optimized for speed when handling requests directly.
- Security: IIS can be configured to handle security-related configurations like SSL, freeing Kestrel to focus on serving dynamic content.
- Manageability: IIS provides a familiar interface for configuration and management, along with advanced logging and diagnostic tools.

Using Kestrel with IIS combines the strengths of both servers, ensuring robust, secure, and high-performing web applications."

# Commonly given poor answer

"Just use Kestrel by itself for everything, even in production, because it’s faster and more efficient than using it with IIS."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Security Risks: Running Kestrel by itself in a production environment exposes it directly to the internet, which can be risky as Kestrel is not designed to defend against attacks as robustly as servers like IIS or Nginx.
- Lack of Advanced Features: Kestrel does not natively handle tasks like SSL termination, load balancing, or advanced static content serving, which are crucial for a production environment.
- Overlooking Best Practices: The recommendation bypasses the industry best practices of using a reverse proxy for additional security and functionality.

This mistake often results from a misunderstanding of Kestrel’s capabilities and the role of a reverse proxy in a production environment. It reflects a lack of experience with deploying applications in securely and effectively managed setups.
