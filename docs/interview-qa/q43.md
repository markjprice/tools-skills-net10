**43. Resilience and transient fault handling**

"Can you describe how you would implement resilience and transient fault handling? Please provide examples of techniques and tools you would use to ensure your application can gracefully handle and recover from failures."

# Good answer

"In building resilient applications, it's essential to anticipate and handle transient faults effectively. This ensures the application remains responsive and available even under adverse conditions. Here are the steps and tools I would use:
- **Retry Policies**: I would use Polly, a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library, to implement retry policies. This helps in situations where operations might occasionally fail due to temporary issues such as network connectivity or timeout issues, as shown in the following code:
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHttpClient("ApiClient", client =>
{
  client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.example.com");
})
.AddTransientHttpErrorPolicy(policy => policy.WaitAndRetryAsync(new[]
{
  TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
  TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
  TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)
}));

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/external-api", async (IHttpClientFactory clientFactory) =>
{
  var client = clientFactory.CreateClient("ApiClient");
  var response = await client.GetAsync("/data");
  return response.IsSuccessStatusCode 
    ? Results.Ok(await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()) 
    : Results.Problem();
});

app.Run();
```
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: I would implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent a fault from repeatedly causing failure. This pattern is useful for handling cases where continuing to perform an action might cause the system more harm. Polly can also be configured to handle this pattern, as shown in the following code:
```cs
.AddTransientHttpErrorPolicy(policy => 
  policy.CircuitBreakerAsync(3, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)));
```

- **Timeouts**: I always set explicit timeouts on all external HTTP calls to ensure that the application does not hang indefinitely when a service it depends on is slow or unresponsive.
- **Fallback Policies**: I would implement fallback policies to provide default values or simplified responses if a call to an external service fails, as shown in the following code:
```cs
.AddTransientHttpErrorPolicy(policy => policy.Or<TimeoutException>()
  .FallbackAsync(new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK) 
  { Content = new StringContent("Fallback response") }));
```

The benefits of implementing all of these policies are the following:
- **Increased Availability**: By handling transient faults effectively, the application remains more available and responsive.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Provides a more consistent and reliable user experience.
- **Protection Against Cascading Failures**: Helps prevent issues in one part of the system from causing widespread problems.

These strategies are essential in building resilient applications that can withstand and recover from the failures common in distributed systems."

# Commonly given poor answer

"Just increase the timeout settings on all your external calls; that should give the services enough time to respond and reduce the chances of failures."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Misunderstanding of Fault Handling: Simply increasing timeout values does not address the root causes of transient faults and can lead to a worse user experience due to longer waiting times.
- Lack of Comprehensive Strategy: This approach does not consider the implementation of a comprehensive strategy involving retries, circuit breakers, and fallbacks, which are necessary to handle different types of failures effectively.
- Potential for Increased System Load: Longer timeouts might exacerbate problems by tying up system resources for extended periods, potentially leading to more significant issues like system overload or failures.

This mistake typically results from a lack of understanding of transient fault handling principles or an oversimplified approach to dealing with errors and exceptions. It underscores the need for a robust strategy to ensure system resilience.
