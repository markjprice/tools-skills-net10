**19. Globalization and localization**

"Can you explain how you would implement globalization and localization in a ASP.NET Core MVC website project to support multiple languages and cultures?"

# Good answer

"Globalization and localization are key to developing applications that can support multiple languages and cultural formats. In ASP.NET Core, this involves configuring services and middleware to support different cultures for content localization and data formatting according to user preferences.

To implement localization in a ASP.NET Core website project, you must configure services in `Program.cs` to add localization support for different cultures, as shown in the following code:
```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Localization; // To use RequestCulture.

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add localization services.
builder.Services.AddLocalization(options =>
  options.ResourcesPath = "Resources");

// Configure supported cultures and localization options.
string[] supportedCultures = new[] { "en-US", "fr-FR", "es-ES" };
builder.Services.Configure<RequestLocalizationOptions>(options =>
{
  options.DefaultRequestCulture = new RequestCulture("en-US");
  options.SupportedCultures = supportedCultures;
  options.SupportedUICultures = supportedCultures;
});

var app = builder.Build();

// Use localization middleware.
app.UseRequestLocalization();

app.MapGet("/", (IStringLocalizer<Program> localizer) => 
  localizer["WelcomeMessage"]);

app.Run();
```

Next, create resource files for each language under the Resources directory, named as `<ClassName>.<Culture>.resx`, for example, `Program.en-US.resx`, `Program.fr-FR.resx`.

Then, inject `IStringLocalizer` into your MVC controllers or view components to fetch localized strings, as shown in the following code:
```cs
public class HomeController : Controller
{
  private readonly IStringLocalizer<HomeController> _localizer;

  public HomeController(IStringLocalizer<HomeController> localizer)
  {
    _localizer = localizer;
  }

  public IActionResult Index()
  {
    ViewData["Message"] = _localizer["HomePageWelcome"];
    return View();
  }
}
```

The advantages of this technique include the following:
- Flexibility and Extensibility: Easily add support for additional languages by adding new resource files.
- Improved User Experience: Users see content in their preferred language, enhancing usability.
- Cultural Accuracy: Properly formatted dates, numbers, and currencies according to the user's locale.

This setup not only supports server-side rendered content but can also be extended to client-side scenarios using JavaScript libraries or through API calls that return localized content."

# Commonly given poor answer

"Just translate the texts on the front end using JavaScript or a client-side library to support multiple languages in your web application."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Client-Side Reliance: This approach suggests an overly simplistic method by relying solely on client-side translation, which can lead to inconsistencies and does not handle server-side rendering or data formatting (like dates and numbers) appropriately.
- Neglect of ASP.NET Core Capabilities: It ignores the built-in support for localization in ASP.NET Core, which is robust and designed to integrate smoothly with the server-side architecture, ensuring that localization preferences are maintained consistently throughout the application.
- Overlooking Accessibility and SEO: Server-side localization is crucial for accessibility and search engine optimization, areas that client-side rendering might not fully address.

The mistake typically occurs due to a lack of understanding of the comprehensive tools and configurations provided by ASP.NET Core for handling localization and globalization effectively across both client-side and server-side environments.
