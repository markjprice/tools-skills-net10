**3. Entity Framework Core**

"Can you explain how Entity Framework Core can be used to handle database operations in .NET applications? Provide an example of configuring EF Core with a SQL Server database in a .NET application and explain how you would perform basic CRUD operations using this setup. Why would you use EF Core in a .NET project?"

# Good answer

"Entity Framework Core is an advanced ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that allows developers to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most data-access code. EF Core supports a wide range of database providers such as SQL Server, SQLite, and PostgreSQL.

To use EF Core in a .NET application, you first need to set up the database context and register it with the dependency injection system. To configure it with a SQL Server database, create a class that derives from `DbContext` and includes `DbSet<T>` properties for the tables in the database, as shown in the following code:
```cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
  public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options)
    : base(options)
  {
  }

  public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
}

public class Product
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

Next, register the context with the SQL Server provider in the `Program.cs`, as shown in the following code:
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
  options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration
  .GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
```

You can now perform CRUD operations, as shown in the following code:
```cs
using var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();
var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ApplicationDbContext>();

// Create a new product.
Product newProduct = new() { Name = "New Product", Price = 9.99M };
context.Products.Add(newProduct);
context.SaveChanges();

// Read all the products.
List<Product> products = context.Products.ToList();
```

The key benefits of using EF Core in a .NET project include the following list:
- Productivity: Automates database schema creation and data manipulation, reducing development time.
- Maintainability: Changes to the data model can be propagated to the database through migrations, facilitating easy database schema updates.
- Abstraction: Provides a high-level abstraction over database interactions, making code cleaner and more readable.
EF Core’s integration into .NET with its built-in dependency injection and configuration systems makes it an ideal choice for developing robust, maintainable database applications."

# Commonly given poor answer

"Just install Entity Framework Core, create your database tables as classes, and it automatically handles everything for you without needing any configuration."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Oversimplification of Configuration and Setup: This answer incorrectly suggests that EF Core requires no explicit configuration or initialization. In reality, EF Core needs proper setup in the application’s startup configuration, including specifying the database provider and connection string.
- Misunderstanding of Automatic Operations: It assumes that EF Core automatically syncs classes with database tables without any additional setup like migrations or database context configuration. This neglects the necessary steps to ensure the database schema matches the data models defined in code.
- Neglect of Best Practices: The response fails to mention best practices such as managing database connections through dependency injection, which are crucial for developing scalable and maintainable applications.

This type of mistake often stems from a lack of detailed knowledge about EF Core’s capabilities and requirements, perhaps based on superficial experiences or misunderstandings about how modern ORM tools function within larger application frameworks.
