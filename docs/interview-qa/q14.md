**14. Dependency injection in .NET**

"How do you implement dependency injection in a .NET application, and what are the key advantages of using DI? Please provide code examples demonstrating how to configure and use DI for managing services and dependencies."

# Good answer

"Dependency injection in .NET is a technique used to achieve loose coupling between objects and their dependencies. By using an inversion of control (IoC) container, .NET manages the creation and injecting of dependencies instead of the classes themselves creating them. This approach simplifies class design, enhances modularity, and improves the testability of applications.

To implement DI in .NET, you typically define your services and interfaces and then register them with the built-in IoC container in the `Program.cs` file, as shown in the following code:
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Registering a scoped service.
builder.Services.AddScoped<IService, MyService>();

var app = builder.Build();

// Using the service in an application component.
app.MapGet("/", (IService service) => {
  return service.PerformOperation();
});

app.Run();
```

In this example, `IService` is an interface and `MyService` is a class that implements `IService`. The service is registered as scoped, meaning a new instance will be created for each request but shared within a single request.

Key Advantages of Using DI:
- Loose Coupling: Objects do not have hard-coded dependencies. This makes the system easier to modify and extend.
- Ease of Testing: Dependencies can be replaced with mocks or stubs during testing, making tests easier to write and more reliable.
- Centralized Configuration: Managing object creation and dependency resolution in one place makes the code cleaner and application easier to scale.

By using DI, developers can ensure that their .NET applications are built with clean architecture principles, focusing on scalability and maintainability."

# Commonly given poor answer

"In .NET, you just need to add services to the `Program.cs` file using `builder.Services.AddSingleton()` or any similar method, and .NET will automatically handle all DI requirements without further configuration."

This response shows an incomplete understanding of DI:
- Lack of Detail on Dependency Consumption: It mentions adding services to the IoC container but fails to explain how these services are consumed in the application. Simply registering a service does not complete the DI process; developers must also inject these services into components where they are needed.
- Oversimplification of DI: The answer implies that DI doesn’t require thoughtful consideration of service lifetimes or how dependencies are injected into consuming classes. It overlooks the importance of choosing the right service lifetime (singleton, scoped, transient) based on the use case.
- Neglect of Implementation Practices: It does not address how dependencies are resolved in different parts of the application, such as controllers, views, or other services. There’s no mention of constructor injection, method injection, or property injection, which are critical for utilizing DI effectively.

This type of mistake typically occurs when a developer knows the basics of adding services to the DI container but lacks a deeper understanding of how to architect applications to fully leverage the benefits of dependency injection.
