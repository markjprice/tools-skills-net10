**60. Big O**

"In a .NET application, you have an array of integers where each number represents the ID of a user. You need to implement a function that identifies and returns any duplicate user IDs in the array. Describe how you would implement this function and discuss the time complexity of your approach using Big O notation."

# Good answer

"To efficiently identify duplicate user IDs, I would use a HashSet to keep track of IDs that we have already seen as we iterate through the array. The HashSet in .NET provides constant time complexity, O(1), for add and check operations. Here's how the function would work:
1.	Initialize an empty HashSet to store the user IDs.
2.	Iterate through each user ID in the array.
3.	For each ID, check if it is already in the HashSet:
    - If it is, this ID is a duplicate, and we can return it or handle it as needed.
    - If it isn’t, add the ID to the HashSet.
4.	Continue this process until all IDs have been checked or a duplicate is found.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of user IDs, because we only pass through the array once, and each operation with the HashSet (adding and checking for existence) is O(1). This is efficient and suitable for large data sets."

# Acceptable Partial Answer (Junior Developer)

"For finding duplicates, I might start by using a simple approach where I use two loops to compare every ID against every other ID. If I find IDs that match, those are duplicates. The time complexity of this method would be O(n^2) because for each user ID, it needs to be compared to every other ID. This isn’t very efficient, especially if there are a lot of user IDs."

The **Good answer** demonstrates a solid understanding of using data structures to optimize algorithms and correctly identifies the efficient time complexity. 

The **Junior Developer’s answer**, while showing a fundamental approach and basic understanding of time complexity, lacks the insight into more efficient methods that are expected at higher levels of expertise. It also provides an opportunity for learning and improvement, which is a valuable trait in junior roles.
