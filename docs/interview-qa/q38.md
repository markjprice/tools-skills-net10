**38. Blazor WebAssembly**

"Can you describe how you would build a client-side web application using Blazor WebAssembly in .NET 8? Include details on how you would set up the project, manage dependencies, and handle API calls."

# Good answer

"Building a client-side web application using Blazor WebAssembly in .NET 8 involves several key steps to effectively leverage the Blazor framework for running .NET code in the browser.
1.	Start by creating a new Blazor WebAssembly project using the .NET CLI, as shown in the following command: `dotnet new blazorwasm -o MyBlazorApp`. This command sets up a new **Blazor WebAssembly Standalone App** project which includes everything needed to get started with a client-side Blazor application.
2.	In a Blazor WebAssembly project, the `Program.cs` is used to set up services and start the application. Dependency injection can be configured here, like a server-side ASP.NET Core application, as shown in the following code:
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add HttpClient for making API calls.
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient
  { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

3.	API calls from a Blazor WebAssembly app are handled using `HttpClient`. You can inject `HttpClient` into your components to make REST API calls, as shown in the following code:
```cs
@inject HttpClient Http

@code {
  private List<Product> products;

  protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
  {
    products = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<List<Product>>("api/products");
  }
}
```

> This component fetches data from a server-side API endpoint and binds it to the UI, allowing Blazor to manage the UI updates reactively.

4.	Blazor handles client-side routing in the `App.razor` file, which decides which component to show based on the URL, as shown in the following code:
```xml
<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
  <Found Context="routeData">
    <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
    <FocusOnNavigate RouteData="@routeData" Selector="h1" />
  </Found>
  <NotFound>
    <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
    <LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
      <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
    </LayoutView>
  </NotFound>
</Router>
```

Key Considerations:
- Performance Optimization: Since the entire application is running in the user's browser, it's crucial to optimize the application size and performance. Lazy loading modules and minimizing the size of the app payload are effective strategies.
- Security: Handle user data securely, especially when making API calls, and ensure that any sensitive logic or data processing that needs to be secure happens on the server-side.

By using Blazor WebAssembly, developers can leverage existing .NET skills and libraries to create rich, interactive web applications without relying on JavaScript frameworks."

# Commonly given poor answer

"Just use Blazor like you would a traditional server-rendered framework. Handle all your logic on the client side, and use JavaScript interop for everything you can’t do in C#."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Misunderstanding of Blazor’s Capabilities and Best Practices: This response indicates a lack of understanding of Blazor’s architecture and its use cases. While Blazor allows for extensive use of C# in the browser, it doesn’t mean all operations should be performed client-side, especially those that are security-sensitive.
- Overreliance on JavaScript Interop: Relying heavily on JavaScript interop defeats one of the main purposes of using Blazor, which is to allow developers to use C# to accomplish tasks typically reserved for JavaScript. While JavaScript interop is useful for accessing browser APIs outside of Blazor’s capabilities, it should be used sparingly.
- Security and Performance Issues: Handling everything on the client-side can lead to significant security and performance issues, especially for applications dealing with sensitive data or requiring intensive computation.

This mistake can stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of how client-side web technologies should be used, especially in terms of security and performance optimizations, or from a developer’s previous experience with more traditional, server-centric web frameworks.
