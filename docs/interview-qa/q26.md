**26. Problem-solving skills**

"Can you describe a challenging technical problem you encountered in a .NET project and explain how you approached solving it? What tools and strategies did you use, and what was the outcome?"

# Good answer
"In a recent .NET project, I encountered a performance issue where the response time of a web API drastically increased under high load. The API was responsible for fetching complex data from a SQL database and transforming it into a specific format for frontend consumption.

I took the following approach to solving this problem:
1.	Identify the Problem: Using logging, I monitored and identified that the bottleneck was occurring during data retrieval and processing.
2.	Hypothesize Solutions: I hypothesized that the problem could be due to inefficient database queries and suboptimal data processing in the API.
3.	Implement and Test Solutions:
    - I first optimized the SQL queries using SQL Server Management Studio to analyze execution plans and found several missing indexes and some queries that could be rewritten for efficiency.
    - Next, I refactored the .NET code to use asynchronous programming patterns. I modified the data access layer to use async and await, ensuring that database operations did not block threads unnecessarily.
4.	Review and Iterate: After implementing the changes, I conducted load testing again and observed a significant improvement in response times. The changes were also reviewed in a peer code review session to ensure they adhered to best practices.
5.	Deploy and Monitor: Post-deployment, I continued to monitor the application's performance and confirmed the issue was resolved.
6.	Outcome: The API's performance improved significantly, handling higher loads with better response times, and the solution also improved the overall scalability of the application.

This experience highlighted the importance of systematic debugging, thorough testing, and the use of robust tools for monitoring and optimizing software."

# Commonly given poor answer

"When I find a problem, I just keep trying different things until something works. Most issues can be solved by trial and error, especially with exceptions and bugs in .NET."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Lack of Systematic Approach: This answer shows a lack of a systematic approach to problem-solving. Relying solely on trial and error can be inefficient and may not necessarily lead to understanding the root cause of an issue.
- Inefficiency and Risk: Randomly trying different solutions without a strategic plan or understanding can lead to further bugs, potentially introduce new issues, and wastes valuable development time.
- Misses Learning Opportunity: This approach fails to capitalize on the learning opportunity presented by challenges. Understanding why a particular solution works is just as important as resolving the problem itself to prevent future issues and improve the engineer's skill set.

This mistake often stems from a lack of experience or a misunderstanding of effective problem-solving techniques in software engineering. It underscores the need for structured problem-solving skills, which are essential for efficient and effective resolution of complex technical issues.
