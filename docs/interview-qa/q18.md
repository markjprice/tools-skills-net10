**18. Data types**

"Can you explain the differences between value types and reference types in .NET, and provide examples of when you would use each?"

# Good answer

"In .NET, value types and reference types are the two main categories of data types. Value types hold data directly and are stored in the stack, which allows for faster access but limited memory space. Common value types include int, double, bool, and structs. They are best used when the data size is small and performance is critical, as they do not incur the overhead associated with the heap allocation.

On the other hand, reference types store a reference to the actual data, which is held in the heap. This allows for more flexible and extensive use of memory but at the cost of additional overhead due to heap allocation and garbage collection. Common reference types include string, arrays, and all classes. Reference types are suitable when you need to manage larger, complex data structures or when data continuity and manipulation are required, as modifications to the data are reflected across all references to the object.

Value types are ideal for simple calculations involving numerical data where immutability and local scope are preferable, like calculating the area of a shape. Reference types are beneficial when dealing with a list of objects that multiple parts of an application might need to access and modify, like a shared configuration object or dynamically generated data such as user input."
