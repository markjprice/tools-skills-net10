**33. Web API development**

"Can you explain how you would design and implement a Web API using the Minimal API features introduced in .NET 6 and extended in .NET 8? Please describe the steps involved in creating a Minimal API and how it simplifies API development compared to earlier versions."

# Good answer

"Minimal APIs provide a streamlined approach to building high-performance, lightweight HTTP APIs. This feature reduces the boilerplate code traditionally required to set up APIs in ASP.NET Core, making it simpler and more direct. Here’s how I would design and implement a Minimal API:
1.	Start by creating a new .NET 8 Web API project. With .NET CLI, you can use: `dotnet new webapi`
2.	In the program file, directly set up your endpoints. Minimal APIs use lambda expressions for inline request handling, which simplifies the routing and controller setup, as shown in the following code:
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/products", async (ApplicationDbContext db) => 
  await db.Products.ToListAsync());

app.MapGet("/products/{id}", async (int id, ApplicationDbContext db) => 
  await db.Products.FindAsync(id) is Product product ? 
    Results.Ok(product) : Results.NotFound());

app.MapPost("/products", async (Product product, ApplicationDbContext db) => 
{
  db.Products.Add(product);
  await db.SaveChangesAsync();
  return Results.Created($"/products/{product.Id}", product);
});

app.MapPut("/products/{id}", async (int id, Product update, ApplicationDbContext db) => 
{
  Product product = await db.Products.FindAsync(id);
  if (product is null) return Results.NotFound();
  product.Name = update.Name;
  product.Price = update.Price;
  await db.SaveChangesAsync();
  return Results.NoContent();
});

app.MapDelete("/products/{id}", 
  async (int id, ApplicationDbContext db) => 
{
  if (await db.Products.FindAsync(id) is Product product)
  {
    db.Products.Remove(product);
    await db.SaveChangesAsync();
    return Results.Ok(product);
  }
  return Results.NotFound();
});

app.Run();
```

3.	Configure any necessary services such as the database context in the builder setup. For instance, adding Entity Framework Core for data access:
```cs
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
  options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration
    .GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
```

4.	Test the API using tools like Postman or Swagger. .NET 8 supports Swagger by default, which can be enabled by:
```cs
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
```

Advantages of Minimal APIs include:
- Reduced Boilerplate: Eliminates the need for separate controllers, making the codebase simpler and smaller.
- Ease of Use: Simplifies the routing setup, making it easier for developers to create and manage APIs.
- Performance: Offers a lightweight alternative to traditional MVC setups, potentially improving performance. Minimal APIs projects can be compiled using native AOT for even greater performance.

This approach leverages the latest .NET features to efficiently build APIs, focusing on simplicity and performance."

# Commonly given poor answer

"Just use controllers like always; these new Minimal APIs are too basic and don’t offer anything that controllers can’t do. It’s better to stick to the standard MVC pattern for APIs."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Resistance to New Features: This answer shows resistance to adopting new frameworks and improvements in technology. Minimal APIs were introduced to simplify and speed up the development of simple APIs, and they are specifically designed to improve the developer experience and performance for suitable scenarios.
- Misunderstanding of Use Case: The response fails to recognize that Minimal APIs are ideal for applications that don't require the full structure of MVC, particularly for microservices or simple CRUD operations.
- Lack of Flexibility: It indicates a lack of flexibility in adopting new practices that can deliver efficiency gains in specific use cases, potentially keeping the team behind in current development trends.

This commonly given poor answer often stems from a lack of understanding of the specific benefits of new features or from a comfort with established patterns, which may not always be the most efficient choice in every scenario.
