**28. Estimation techniques**

"Can you describe different estimation techniques you have used in your .NET projects and explain how these techniques have helped you ensure project delivery within timelines?"

# Good answer

"In my experience managing .NET projects, I've utilized a combination of estimation techniques to ensure accurate forecasting and efficient project management. These include Expert Judgment, Planning Poker, and Use Case Point Analysis.
- Expert Judgment: This involves consulting with experienced team members to get estimates based on their past experiences. For example, when working on a .NET 8 project involving ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core, I would discuss the tasks with senior developers who have similar project experiences to get a realistic sense of effort and duration.
- Planning Poker: This Agile estimation technique uses consensus to estimate tasks. Each team member provides an estimate using numbered cards, and discussions follow until the team reaches a consensus. This technique is particularly useful for involving the entire team in the estimation process, which increases commitment and accuracy of the estimates. Here's how it might be facilitated:
    1. Each developer receives cards with numbers representing story points.
    2. The product owner describes a feature.
    3. Developers select a card representing their estimate without revealing it.
    4. All cards are revealed simultaneously, and discrepancies are discussed until consensus is reached.
- Use Case Point Analysis: This technique is adapted for estimating the effort required for user stories that involve user interactions. It considers the complexity of the use cases and adjusts for technical and environmental factors. I apply this technique by categorizing each use case into simple, average, or complex, and then assigning a weight based on these categories. This is particularly effective for projects with clear functional requirements, like a .NET web service with multiple endpoints.

By employing these techniques, I have been able to provide more reliable estimates that accommodate uncertainties and allow for better planning and risk management. This multi-technique approach helps ensure that projects are delivered on time and within scope, even when unforeseen complexities arise."

# Commonly given poor answer

"For estimation, I just double the time I think it will take to code. This usually gives enough buffer for testing and unforeseen issues."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Lack of Sophistication: This approach is overly simplistic and does not consider the detailed aspects of the tasks at hand. Estimation is not just about padding time but understanding the complexity and risks involved.
- Inaccuracy and Inefficiency: Simply doubling the estimated coding time does not accurately reflect the true effort needed, especially for tasks that may not be linear in complexity or effort. This method can lead to poor resource allocation and either overestimates or underestimates of the actual time needed.
- Misses Stakeholder Involvement: This technique fails to involve other team members and stakeholders who may offer valuable insights into the estimation process. It does not leverage the collective experience and expertise of the team, which can lead to less commitment to the project timelines.

This mistake often stems from a lack of experience with formal estimation techniques or from working in environments where detailed planning was not prioritized. It underscores the need for a structured approach to estimation in software project management, especially for larger or more complex .NET projects.
