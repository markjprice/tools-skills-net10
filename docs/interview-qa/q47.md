**47. ADO.NET fundamentals**

"How would you utilize ADO.NET to manage database operations in a .NET 8 application using Minimal APIs? Please describe how you handle connection management, execute queries, and manage transactions."

# Good answer

"ADO.NET provides a powerful set of libraries for data access in .NET applications, allowing direct control over database connections, commands, and transactions. Hereâ€™s how I would implement ADO.NET in a .NET 8 application using Minimal APIs:
1.	Manage the database connection string securely using configuration settings in `appsettings.json` and access it through the configuration API, as shown in the following code:
```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
string connectionString = builder.Configuration
  .GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/data", async (HttpContext http) =>
{
  using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
  {
    conn.Open();
    // Additional command execution logic here
    return Results.Ok("Database connection established");
  }
});

app.Run();
```

2.	Use `SqlCommand` to execute SQL queries. It's crucial to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, as shown in the following code:
```cs
app.MapGet("/products", async () =>
{
  List<string> products = new List<string>();
  using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
  {
    conn.Open();
    string query = "SELECT Name FROM Products";
    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn))
    {
      using (SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
      {
        while (reader.Read())
        {
          products.Add(reader.GetString(0));
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return Results.Ok(products);
});
```

3.	Handle transactions explicitly when performing multiple related write operations to ensure data integrity.
```cs
app.MapPost("/update-inventory", async (HttpContext http) =>
{
  using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
  {
    conn.Open();
    SqlTransaction transaction = conn.BeginTransaction();
    try
    {
      SqlCommand cmd = conn.CreateCommand();
      cmd.Transaction = transaction;
      cmd.CommandText = "UPDATE Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - 1 WHERE ProductId = @ProductId";
      cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ProductId", 1);
      cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();

      // Potentially more commands here

      transaction.Commit();
      return Results.Ok("Inventory updated");
    }
    catch
    {
      transaction.Rollback();
      return Results.Problem("Error updating inventory");
    }
  }
});
```

Benefits:
- **Control**: Direct management of SQL connections and transactions offers full control over database interactions.
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of database connections and operations, particularly in high-load scenarios. ADO.NET also works with native AOT while currently EF Core does not.
- **Security**: Using parameterized queries helps prevent SQL injection attacks.

This approach demonstrates how to effectively utilize ADO.NET in a modern .NET 8 Minimal API application, ensuring robust, secure, and efficient database operations."

# Commonly given poor answer

"Just open a connection and run your SQL commands directly in the API endpoints; ADO.NET handles everything else automatically."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Poor Connection Management: This response shows a lack of understanding regarding the need for careful management of database connections, which can lead to resource leaks and performance issues if connections are not properly closed or disposed.
- Security Risks: Running SQL commands directly without parameterization exposes the application to SQL injection attacks, a common security vulnerability.
- Neglect of Transaction Management: It overlooks the importance of managing transactions when executing multiple related database operations, potentially leading to data inconsistencies.

This incorrect answer likely stems from a misunderstanding of best practices in database operations or a lack of experience with the complexities of handling data securely and efficiently in high-load or enterprise-level applications.
