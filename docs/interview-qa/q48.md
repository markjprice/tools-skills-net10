**48. Entity Framework Core performance tuning**

"How would you optimize the performance of Entity Framework Core? Please provide specific examples of techniques and configurations you would use to enhance the efficiency of database interactions."

# Good answer

"Optimizing Entity Framework Core involves several strategies to minimize overhead and improve data access performance. Here’s how I would approach performance tuning:
- When the data does not need to be updated in the current context, using AsNoTracking can improve performance significantly by reducing the overhead of tracking changes, as shown in the following code:
```cs
List<Product> products = await dbContext.Products.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();
```
- Avoid using lazy loading in scenarios where it can lead to N+1 query problems. Instead, use explicit loading or eager loading to fetch all necessary data in a single query, as shown in the following code:
```cs
Order order = await dbContext.Orders
  .Where(o => o.Id == orderId)
  .Include(o => o.OrderItems)
  .ThenInclude(oi => oi.Product)
  .SingleOrDefaultAsync();
```
- Always filter and limit the size of the data returned from the database to what is necessary. Applying filters at the database level, rather than fetching all records and filtering in memory, can drastically reduce latency and memory usage.
- Ensure that indexes are appropriately used in the database to speed up query performance, especially for columns that are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses or as `JOIN` conditions.
- Regularly profile SQL queries generated by EF Core using tools like SQL Profiler or the built-in logging facilities to identify inefficient queries and further optimize them.

By integrating these practices, you can significantly enhance the performance of applications using EF Core, making them more responsive and scalable."

# Commonly given poor answer

"Just use `.Include()` for all related data to avoid multiple queries to the database. It’s simpler and ensures all data is loaded at once."

Explanation of why this is wrong:
- Overuse of Eager Loading: The indiscriminate use of `.Include()` can lead to significantly more data being loaded than necessary, especially when pulling in multiple related entities. This can greatly increase memory usage and degrade performance, known as the "SELECT N+1 problem".
- Increased Payloads and Latency: Loading all related data in a single query without careful consideration of actual data needs can result in large payloads and increased latency, particularly harmful in network-heavy environments or applications with high concurrent access.
- Lack of Tailored Query Optimization: This approach shows a lack of nuanced understanding of EF Core’s capabilities and ignores more refined methods like explicit loading or selective projection, which can provide better performance benefits.

This common mistake often stems from a misunderstanding of EF Core’s loading strategies and a lack of experience in performance optimization within complex ORM environments.
