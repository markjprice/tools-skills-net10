# Sample interview questions

Now let's review 60 commonly asked questions in .NET software engineer position interviews. 

The 60 items include a question, a good answer, and a poor answer with an explanation of why it is poor. You will learn almost as much from reviewing poor answers as good ones.

I encourage you to get access to a whiteboard and ask a friend to read the questions to you. Answer them verbally and record your responses on video to review later. This will force you to practice writing code on a whiteboard in a stressful environment. 

As you review these sample interview questions, you will note commonalities, especially in the poor answers:
- **Oversimplification**: A poor response will oversimplify the concept, technology, or process. This is a sign that the interviewee may only have learned a few key phrases related to the question, without any deeper understanding. At a minimum, you should have written code and seen it run for any technology you get asked about. It's fine to be honest and explain that you have not implemented a technology in a real project, only in learning exercises. 
- **Unaware of Best Practices**: A poor response will often neglect the best practices in a technology area.
- **Misunderstanding**: A poor response will . It is better to acknowledge areas where you have a vaguer understanding. Most employers would rather an employee asked questions when they are unsure rather than pretend they know what they are doing!
