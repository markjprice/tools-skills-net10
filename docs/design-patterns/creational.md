# Creational patterns

The first set of design patterns that programmers learn are usually Creational patterns because you can't do anything without first creating one or more objects. The essence of these patterns is to give your program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case. Instead of your program directly instantiating objects, creational patterns provide a way to encapsulate this knowledge within the program, making it more modular, flexible, and maintainable. They abstract the instantiation process, making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
