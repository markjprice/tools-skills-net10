# Iterator pattern

The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It's particularly useful when you want to traverse a collection in various ways, or when you have a complex data structure and you want to hide the complexities of traversal from the user. 

The pattern involves two main components: 
- **Iterator**: responsible for defining an interface for accessing and traversing elements.
- **Aggregate**: defines an interface for creating an iterator object to traverse its elements.

In .NET, the Iterator pattern is inherently supported through the `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerator` interfaces in the `System.Collections` namespace, and the `IEnumerable<T>` and `IEnumerator<T>` interfaces in the `System.Collections.Generics` namespace. Implementing these interfaces allows any collection to be iterated over using the `foreach` loop, which internally uses the iterator pattern.

By adhering to `IEnumerable` and `IEnumerator`, you leverage .NET's built-in support for the Iterator pattern, making your collections compatible with the `foreach` loop and other .NET features that work with iterators like LINQ. This approach is more robust, easier to use, and integrates well with the rest of .NET.
