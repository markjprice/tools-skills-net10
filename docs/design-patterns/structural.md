# Structural design patterns

Structural design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. The focus is on simplifying the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same, thus promoting reusability and modularity.
